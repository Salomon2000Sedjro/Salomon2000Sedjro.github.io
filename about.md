Welcome to my personal webpage!
Here, I share my research and also some facts from my everyday life.

I am **Sedjro Salomon Hotegni** from **Benin**. You can take a look at my last post and if you liked it, why not go to the previous ones! I will be happy to receive feedback from you.

Oops, I forgot one thing: my background.
I have a Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Abomey-Calavi in Benin before traveling to **Rwanda** where I obtained a Master's degree in Mathematical Sciences with a specialization in Data Science. I am passionate about **Artificial Intelligence** and everything related to it.

Glad you visited my page. Stay connected !
